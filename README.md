# Overview

This was a personal project to help refine my skills with programming in Java.  On some days, I don't have a whole lot to do, but there's so much I could be doing that I have a hard time finding out what to do.  This program basically makes that decision for me.

Here are a few of the things that this program encourages me to do:

* Do something productive (mostly cleaning around my apartment)*
* Organize photos on my phone or laptop
* Watch some TV*
* Play a video game*
* Read a book (specifically I'm reading Star Wars High Republic: Light of the Jedi)
* Add music to my playlist

The things marked by an asterisk (*) have their own separate files that have a list of shows to watch, games to play, or tasks to complete.  These are all decided with random number generators throughout my main function.  This is still a work in progress and will continue to recieve updates, either in the functionality of this program or just the content of the txt files that I have.
